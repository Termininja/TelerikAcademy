## Numeral Systems

**Task 1.** Write a program to convert decimal numbers to their binary representation.

**Task 2.** Write a program to convert binary numbers to their decimal representation.

**Task 3.** Write a program to convert decimal numbers to their hexadecimal representation.

**Task 4.** Write a program to convert hexadecimal numbers to their decimal representation.

**Task 5.** Write a program to convert hexadecimal numbers to binary numbers (directly).

**Task 6.** Write a program to convert binary numbers to hexadecimal numbers (directly).

**Task 7.** Write a program to convert from any numeral system of given base s to any other numeral system of base d (2 ≤ s, d ≤  16).

**Task 8.** Write a program that shows the binary representation of given 16-bit signed integer number (the C# type short).

**Task 9\*.** Write a program that shows the internal binary representation of given 32-bit signed floating-point number in IEEE 754 format (the C# type float).
>Example: -27,25 → **sign = 1, exponent = 10000011, mantissa = 10110100000000000000000**
