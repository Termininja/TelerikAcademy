## Code Tuning & Optimization

**Task 01.** You are given a C# application which displays an animated 3D model of the Solar system.
  * Use a profiler to find the places in its source code which cause significant performance degradation (bottlenecks).
    * Provide a screenshot of the profilerâ€™s result and indicate the place in the source code where the bottleneck resides (name of the file, line of code).
  * Make a quick fix in the source code in order to significantly improve the performance. Test the code after the fix for correctness + performance.

**Task 02.** Write a program to compare the performance of add, subtract, increment, multiply, divide for `int`, `long`, `float`, `double` and `decimal` values.

**Task 03.** Write a program to compare the performance of square root, natural logarithm, sinus for `float`, `double` and `decimal` values.

**Task 04\*.** Write a program to compare the performance of insertion sort, selection sort, quicksort for `int`, `double` and `string` values. Check also the following cases: random values, sorted values, values sorted in reversed order.
