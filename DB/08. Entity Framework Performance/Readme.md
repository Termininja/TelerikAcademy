## Entity Framework Performance

**Task 01.** Using Entity Framework write a SQL query to select all employees from the Telerik Academy database and later print their name, department and town. Try the both variants: with and without `.Include(â€¦)`. Compare the number of executed SQL statements and the performance.

**Task 02.** Using Entity Framework write a query that selects all employees from the Telerik Academy database, then invokes `ToList()`, then selects their addresses, then invokes `ToList()`, then selects their towns, then invokes `ToList()` and finally checks whether the town is "Sofia". Rewrite the same in more optimized way and compare the performance.
