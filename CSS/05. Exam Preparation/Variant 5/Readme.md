## CSS Exam – Variant 5

#### Exam terms – Read carefully!

During the exam you **are allowed** to use any teaching materials, lectures, books, existing source code, and other paper or Internet resources.

Direct or indirect communication with anyone in the class or outside the room is absolutely **forbidden**.

You must submit only **one ZIP file** with the three CSS files, labeled **task1.css**, **task2.css** and **task3.css**.

The trainers will give you a link to download ZIP with the assignments. In the ZIP you will find three folders, titled **task1**, **task2** and **task3**.

Each of the folders contains a folder titled **task**, an **HTML** file and empty **CSS** file, and may contain JavaScript files or other images. Your task is to write the **CSS** to the **HTML** file, so that it looks as similar as possible to all the images in **task folders**.

**Important:** you are not allowed to **change the HTML file or the name of the CSS file**.

Only your **last** code submission will be evaluated. You have exactly **3 hours** to solve all given problems.
