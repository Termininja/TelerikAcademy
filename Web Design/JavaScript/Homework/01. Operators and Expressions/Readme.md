## Operators and Expressions

**Task 01.** Write an expression that checks if given integer is odd or even.

**Task 02.** Write a boolean expression that checks for given integer if it can be divided (without remainder) by 7 and 5 in the same time.

**Task 03.** Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area by given `width` and `height`.

**Task 04.** Write an expression that checks for given integer if its third digit (right-to-left) is 7.
>Example: 1732 → **true**

**Task 05.** Write a boolean expression for finding if the bit 3 (counting from 0) of a given integer is 1 or 0.
