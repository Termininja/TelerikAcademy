## Arrays ([Demo](https://rawcdn.githack.com/Termininja/TelerikAcademy/8ce035c8/JS/05.%20Arrays/index.html))

**Task 01.** Write a script that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by 5. Print the obtained array on the console.

**Task 02.** Write a script that compares two `char` arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).

**Task 03.** Write a script that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array.
>Example: {2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1} → **{2, 2, 2}**

**Task 04.** Write a script that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array.
>Example: {3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4} → **{2, 3, 4}**

**Task 05.** `Sorting` an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order. Write a script to sort an array. Use the *"selection sort"* algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.
* Hint: Use a second array

**Task 06.** Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array.
>Example: {4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 4, 9, 3} → **4 (5 times)**

**Task 07.** Write a program that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers by using the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm>binary search</a> algorithm (find it in Wikipedia).
