/*
 * Task 1: Create a ChaoticParticle class, which is a Particle, randomly changing its movement (Speed).
 *         You are not allowed to edit any existing class.
 * 
 * Task 2: Test the ChaoticParticle through the ParticleSystemMain class.
 * 
 * Task 3: Create a ChickenParticle class. The ChickenParticle class moves like a ChaoticParticle,
 *         but randomly stops at different positions for several simulation ticks and, for each of those stops,
 *         creates (lays) a new ChickenParticle. You are not allowed to edit any existing class.
 * 
 * Task 4: Test the ChickenParticle class through the ParcticleSystemMain class.
 * 
 * Task 5: Implement a ParticleRepeller class. A ParticleRepeller is a Particle, which pushes other particles
 *         away from it (i.e. accelerates them in a direction, opposite of the direction in which the repeller is).
 *         The repeller has an effect only on particles within a certain radius (see Euclidean distance).
 * 
 * Task 6: Test the ParticleRepeller class through the ParticleSystemMain class.
