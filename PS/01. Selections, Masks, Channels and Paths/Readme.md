## Selections, masks, channels and tracks

**Task 1.** Extract from a high quality photo to:
   * a complex object (hair, flower, tree, etc.) + background image
   * a simpler object (for example, household, car, etc.) + background image

The goal is to make two nice collages, but also the selections must be preserved (like masks in the alpha channel). If there is a vector path used - also be saved in paths.

It is good to use all types of selection during work, geometrical + quick selection + quick mask, and work with channels + image calculation + levels. Keep the masks for subsequent reversal if necessary!

**Task 2.** Draw a simple object (for example, an icon) by using vector path. Then use it to make a clip mask on one of the previous collages.

**All tasks** must be in **a PSD file** sent as zip. Inside, each task is in a separate group (ie 3 layer groups), and all layers have appropriate names. **File size does not exceed 1280x800**!

Additional points will be given for **precision**, **exact job adherence** and **creativity**.
